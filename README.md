# ListAllPostsFromDeletedProfiles
Stack Exchange mod userscript: Show all posts from a user's user history page

When a user has a lot of deleted profiles and they each have deleted posts, getting the full picture about a user's full history is difficult, because you'd need to open the page that shows each individual deleted profile's posts. Kind of a pain.

This script adds a button that shows a table with every post from the whole user history.

This script is compatible with [User History improvements](https://github.com/samliew/SO-mod-userscripts/blob/master/README.md#user-history-improvements-) by Sam Liew.
